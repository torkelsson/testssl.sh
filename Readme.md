`testssl.sh` is a free command line tool which checks a server's service on any port for the support of TLS/SSL ciphers, protocols as well as some cryptographic flaws. It's designed to provide clear output in any case.

It is working on every Linux distribution out of the box with some limitations of disabled features from the openssl client -- some workarounds are done with bash-socket-based checks. It also works on BSD and other Unices out of the box, supposed they have `/bin/bash` and standard tools like sed and awk installed. MacOS X and Windows (using MSYS2 or cygwin) work too. OpenSSL version >= 1 is a must.  OpenSSL version >= 1.0.2 is needed for better LOGJAM checks and to display bit strengths for key exchanges.

On github you will find in the master branch the development version of the software -- with new features and maybe some bugs. For the stable version and a more thorough description of the software please see [testssl.sh](https://testssl.sh/ "Go to the site with the stable version and more documentation"). 

Planned features in the release 2.7dev/2.8 are: 

https://github.com/drwetter/testssl.sh/milestones/2.7dev%20%282.8%29

Done so far:

* Trust chain check against certificate stores from java, linux (system), microsoft, mozilla (works for openssl >=1.0.2)
* IPv6 (status: 80% working, details see https://github.com/drwetter/testssl.sh/issues/11
* works on servers requiring a client certificate for authentication
* SSL Session ID check
* avahi/mDNS based name resolution
* Even more compatibilty improvements for FreeBSD and RH-ish systems

Contributions, feedback, also bug reports are welcome! For contributions please note: One patch per feature -- bug fix/improvement. Please test your changes thouroughly as reliability is important for this project.
